    "For submission, please form a group of three students. You have to be assigned to a group in Ilias.\n",
    "You can use the \"[Looking for a group](https://ilias.studium.kit.edu/ilias.php?ref_id=1948869&cmd=render&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=x1&baseClass=ilRepositoryGUI)\" forum to team up.\n",

    "**The exercises should be solved and submitted as a group of three students.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the submission of the exercise please follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure that every cell is executed and that your plots are properly displayed and saved.\n",
    "2. Create a .zip file of your filled-in notebook, a potential pen & paper solution (for some exercises only), and the folder containing your saved plots.\n",
    "By default, the plot folder will be in your Google Drive in `rl_ws23/exercise_i/date` for the i-th exercise.\n",
    "3. Rename your zip file with the following naming convention: `group_y_uxxxx_uxxxx_uxxxx`, where `y` is your group number, `uxxxx` is the kit user from each group member.\n",
    "4. Upload the zip file to Ilias.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, please try to fill in the code where stated.\n",
    "It demonstrates some basic operations we will need for this course.\n",
    "Then, submit this exercise following the instructions above.\n",
    "This submission is only for getting familiar with the submission procedure, it will not be graded.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "Usually, each coding exercise will provide you with a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "These notebooks contain markdown/text cells (such as this one), and python code cells (like the ones further below).\n",
    "Each code cell can be run separately, and access a global state for the whole notebook.\n",
    "Code that has been compiled in one cell (such as functions, classes or imports) is available in other cells.\n",
    "It is also possible to use $\\LaTeX$ equations inside the markdown environment.\n",
    "You can freely edit the code in the code-cells, and then compile a cell by clicking on the arrow next to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the exercises, you will be provided with an incomplete algorithm and are required to fill in missing methods and functions.\n",
    "These incomplete segments are marked with **TODO** statements, and often contain hints on what exactly needs to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Colab\n",
    "You have the option to either run Jupyter notebook either locally using an IDE, or in the cloud using Google Colab.\n",
    "Google Colab will directly save logs and recordings to a designated folder in your Google Drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you may want to use an IDE on your PC instead, and only deploy experiments on the cluster.\n",
    "For this, we recommend using either [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "As a student, you can get educational licenses for both from the [KIT Software Shop](https://www.scc.kit.edu/dienste/4800.php).\n",
    "We recommend using conda (or mamba) for managing a virtual environment with all the Python packages required for the exercises."

    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an automatic differentiation framework that builds on NumPy. It offers a wide range of tools and pre-build blocks for different machine learning approaches. We will mainly use PyTorch for the *deep* part of Deep Reinforcement Learning, i.e., to build and train deep neural networks.\n",
    "* To get started with PyTorch, we recommend [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)\n",
